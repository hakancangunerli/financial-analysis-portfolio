# Quant-strategy
A test strategy that uses the following ETFs Mutual Funds, indexes and various other metrics to create a list of funds to check if it can beat the S&P. The repository [here](https://github.com/hakancangunerli/investopedia_logger) aims to semi-regularly be updated to get the results of these equity holdings and provide the results in a simulated trading environment in Investopedia. Initially, the starting cash is $100,000.00. 

Note: I'm still unsure as to whether the hedge fund data and funds holding should be updated. It _could_ be updated, but depending on the "success" of the strategy, I'll decide.
